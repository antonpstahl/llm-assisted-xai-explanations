# LLM-Assisted Explanation of Machine Learning Model Outputs: The Effect of XAI Method and Handover Format on Explanation Quality

Comparing how the **choice of XAI method** and the **handover format** to a large language model (LLM) affect the quality of automatically generated, natural-language explanations of ML predictions.

This repository accompanies a research seminar paper (*Belegarbeit*) at **TU Dresden**, supervised by **Prof. Dr. Patrick Zschech** (Chair of Business Information Systems, esp. Intelligent Systems and Services).

## Key findings

1. **LLMs over-describe negligible features.** Judge faithfulness drops from 5.00 for monotonic features to 3.85 for near-flat ones. Every handover format over-attributes there, including the deterministic template.
2. **For a single feature, the handover format makes no detectable difference.** On the primary judge no pairwise comparison is significant (all `p_adj ≥ 0.38`). A deterministic template is not detectably worse than any LLM format.
3. **One generation is not a measurement.** Re-drawing the same cells gives a within-cell spread about 1.8× the difference between formats, and resampling produces all six possible format rankings.
4. **For the whole model, pull ≈ numeric push.** Tool use and JSON handover lie within 0.05 of each other, and every stated feature rank is correct (90 / 90).
5. **LLM judges disagree.** Cross-vendor agreement on faithfulness is moderate at best (Krippendorff's α 0.48 per feature, 0.30 whole-model), and the two vendors order the conditions differently. Comparisons are therefore reported within one judge.

**Stage codes used below:**
- **G0:** global explanation artefacts (curves, beeswarms)
- **G1:** the constructed EBM beeswarm
- **G2a:** one feature per LLM call
- **G2b:** the whole model per LLM call
- **G3:** ground truth and scoring

## Overview

The project studies how LLMs can translate predictions from machine-learning models into natural-language explanations for non-expert end users. The application case is the **Capital Bikeshare** system in Washington, D.C., an hourly bike-rental demand dataset.

Two questions are examined in parallel:

1. **XAI method**: do explanations grounded in an *inherently interpretable* model (EBM shape functions) beat *post-hoc* explanations (SHAP on XGBoost)?
2. **Handover format**: does the LLM produce better explanations when it receives the information as **structured JSON**, as an **image** (plot, PNG), or through **active tool calls** (tool-use)?

### Two tracks

The project runs on **two tracks**, and the **global track is the main one**:

| Track | Unit of explanation | Notebooks | n | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Global** (main) | how the model uses a **feature**, and the **whole model** | `04Ga-04Ge`, `05G`, `05Gb` | 72 per-feature + 90 whole-model records | carries the findings |
| **Local** (comparison) | why **one instance** got its prediction | `04La-04Ld`, `05`, `06` | 20 explanations per pipeline | comparison basis, kept reproducible |

The global track scores every description against a **structured ground truth** (18
references, all 18 mechanically verified) with two independent scorers: a deterministic
keyword **rubric** and a reference-based **LLM judge**, the latter run across **two
vendors** (Anthropic Opus + OpenAI) as a robustness check.

## Pipeline

**1. Data preprocessing** (`01_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`)
UCI Bike Sharing dataset (17,379 hourly observations, 2011-2012). Leakage and redundant features removed; multicollinearity handled (`atemp` vs. `temp`, r ≈ 0.99); categorical encoding for native splits; the target is the raw hourly count `cnt` and the models are trained with Poisson deviance (log link), which absorbs the right skew internally, so no `log1p` target transform is applied; **day-level** 70/30 train/test split (whole days assigned as units, 511 train days, 220 test days, no day in both, so neighbouring hours of the same day never straddle the split). Nine features remain (`hr`, `mnth`, `weekday`, `weathersit`, `yr`, `holiday`, `temp`, `hum`, `windspeed`).

**2. Modeling** (`02a_Modeling_AllOptions.ipynb`, `02b_Comparison.ipynb`)
XGBoost and EBM (InterpretML), each trained with three loss functions. Poisson-log was selected for all downstream steps (best Poisson deviance, no negative predictions).

<!-- AUTO-TABLE:model-metrics -->
| Loss        | Model | RMSE  | MAE   | R²    | Poisson dev. | Neg. pred. |
| ----------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Poisson-log | XGB   | 45.44 | 27.00 | 0.935 | 9.38         | 0          |
| Poisson-log | EBM   | 48.20 | 28.20 | 0.927 | 10.81        | 0          |
<!-- /AUTO-TABLE:model-metrics -->

(Test set n = 5,227; values from `results/model_metrics_poisson_log.json`.)

**3. Explanation generation** (`03_Explanations_Generation.ipynb`)
Global explanations (SHAP feature importance for XGB; term importances for EBM) and local explanations for 10 test instances stratified across `cnt` quintiles, stored as JSON plus waterfall-plot PNGs. The global track additionally derives, per feature, a **shape/dependence curve** and a **beeswarm** (`explanations/global_curve_*.json`, `explanations/plots/global/`); for the EBM, whose library has no beeswarm, one is **constructed** from the shape functions and validated against the XGB SHAP swarm (rank Spearman 0.883, direction agreement 100 %).

---

## Global track (main): how does the model use its features?

The unit of explanation is not a single prediction but the **model's use of a feature** and, in `04Ge`, the **whole model at once**. Every description is scored against a structured ground truth.

**Ground truth** (`explanations/global_groundtruth/`, 18 references = 9 features × 2 XAI models). Per feature: shape type (`monotonic` / `non-monotonic` / `categorical` / `near-flat`), direction, importance rank, peak, top categories. Derived mechanically from the G0 curves via one shared `classify_shape` helper, the **same** helper the deterministic baseline uses, so the two cannot drift apart. All 18 references pass a mechanical re-derivation (`analyses/gt_verification.md`); a threshold sensitivity sweep leaves 15/18 labels stable across the whole grid, with the three border cases named explicitly.

**G2a, one feature per call** (`04Ga`–`04Gd`): four handover forms × 2 XAI models × 9 features = **72** descriptions, scored by the deterministic rubric *and* the reference-based judge (two vendors).

<!-- AUTO-TABLE:global-feature -->
| Form     | Rubric total | Judge Faith. | Clarity | Complete. | Faith. (OpenAI) |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------- | --------- | --------------- |
| Template | 0.944        | 4.50         | 4.06    | 5.00      | 4.72            |
| JSON     | 0.889        | 4.28         | 4.00    | 5.00      | 3.44            |
| Vision   | 0.907        | 4.61         | 3.67    | 5.00      | 3.83            |
| Tool Use | 0.880        | 4.44         | 3.67    | 5.00      | 3.83            |
<!-- /AUTO-TABLE:global-feature -->

On the Anthropic judge `vision` leads nominally at 4.61 and the template is second at 4.50, with no pairwise comparison significant (Wilcoxon signed-rank on `(feature, xai_model)` pairs, Holm-corrected, all `p_adj ≥ 0.38`; five of six Cliff's *d* negligible, `json`–`vision` small at δ = −0.17). On the OpenAI judge the template leads all three LLM formats and template–`json` reaches `p_adj = 0.030` with δ = 0.57, but the crossing depends on a single verdict (0.067 if `json_ebm_weathersit` is scored 5) and does not survive correction across both judges (0.061). Because the template shares its shape classifier with the ground truth, it hits the shape type *by construction*. It is therefore a strict **reference floor** rather than an independent competitor. Rubric and judge correlate at Spearman 0.458 (n = 72, p < 0.001): internal consistency between two ground-truth-bound scorers, not independent criterion validity.

The stable finding is not a modality ranking but a **failure mode**:

<!-- AUTO-TABLE:global-formtype -->
| Shape type    | n  | Judge Faith. | Clarity | Complete. |
| ------------- | -- | ------------ | ------- | --------- |
| near-flat     | 20 | 3.85         | 4.20    | 5.00      |
| categorical   | 28 | 4.54         | 3.71    | 5.00      |
| non-monotonic | 16 | 4.81         | 3.62    | 5.00      |
| monotonic     | 8  | 5.00         | 3.88    | 5.00      |
<!-- /AUTO-TABLE:global-formtype -->

**Over-attribution of negligible features** is the consistent error, converging across rubric, judge and the qualitative analysis (`analyses/error_examples_by_formtype.md`). The stratum sizes are too small for tests, so these are descriptive means.

**G2b, the whole model per call** (`04Ge`, exploratory): five conditions × 2 XAI models. Each answer must emit a rigid `[FEATURE: name] [EFFECT] … [IMPORTANCE] …` block per feature; `split_whole_model_record` cuts it into **90** per-feature records the same rubric and judge score unchanged. A feature the answer omits counts as a miss, which makes **coverage** directly measurable.

<!-- AUTO-TABLE:global-whole -->

<!-- /AUTO-TABLE:global-whole -->

Two axes this opens that the per-feature track cannot:

- **Mechanism (push vs pull)**: `tooluse_all` (pull) and `json_all` (numeric push) lie within 0.05 of each other on the fair aggregate on both XAI models, and no push–pull difference across the four (push, arm) cells exceeds 0.05:

| Push condition | XAI model | pull | push | pull − push |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `json_all` | ebm | 0.972 | 0.972 | 0.000 |
| `json_all` | xgb | 0.926 | 0.963 | −0.037 |
| `vision_all` | ebm | 0.972 | 0.926 | +0.046 |
| `vision_all` | xgb | 0.926 | 0.889 | +0.037 |

  "Pull ≈ numeric push" is therefore the honest reading at whole-model complexity; treat "pull architecture" as a design expectation rather than a headline result. (`utils.global_eval.axis2_mechanism_pairwise`)
- **Representation**: `vision_all` states all 9 ranks on both XAI arms, all correct (`fair_total` 0.926 on EBM, 0.889 on XGB). The answers quote the importance printed in each plot title (XGB `holiday`: *"least important feature in the model (importance 0.012)"*). On the XGB arm the plotted vertical range would mislead as a rank proxy (Spearman ρ = 0.23 against ground-truth rank; `holiday` has the second-widest scatter but rank 9); the answers follow the printed value instead. Where a rank is stated it is exactly correct in every whole-model condition (**90 / 90** total, across the five conditions on both XAI arms). The remaining gap between `vision_all` and `json_all` on XGB sits in the structure sub-score (0.722 vs. 0.889), not in the rank column.

> **Beeswarm readability.** `json_beeswarm` and `vision_beeswarm` are information-matched (rank + colour direction + rough spread, **no** per-value curve), so the difference isolates the pure modality effect. On the fair aggregate the image scores essentially as well as the equivalent numbers (`json_beeswarm` 1.000 / 0.972 vs. `vision_beeswarm` 0.917 / 0.972).

**Process metrics (G2a).** Straight off the persisted generation records:

<!-- AUTO-TABLE:global-process -->
| Form     | Avg input tok. | Avg output tok. | Avg latency | Avg tool calls |
| -------- | -------------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Template | 0              | 0               | 0.0 s       | n/a            |
| JSON     | 82,421         | 720             | 18.2 s      | n/a            |
| Vision   | 1,554          | 704             | 17.8 s      | n/a            |
| Tool Use | 69,228         | 901             | 25.0 s      | 3.1            |
<!-- /AUTO-TABLE:global-process -->

Two things to read here. First, **the modality comparison is not information-matched**: JSON receives the raw per-instance SHAP scatter (~12k points per feature) and Vision only the rendered plot, a **53:1** input-token ratio. The comparison therefore measures information *volume* as well as modality. G2b fixes this by aggregating the curve to a grid; G2a deliberately does not, and the asymmetry cuts in a useful direction: JSON had 53× the information and still did not beat the deterministic template. Second, **Tool-Use averages only 3.1 calls**, and the sequence is nearly fixed: `get_feature_importances` is called in **18 / 18** records (first in 15 of them), followed by `get_feature_curve` and, in 16 of 18 records, `get_feature_plot`. The loop pulls the full rank context every time, but the tool-use prompt already names those tools "per feature", so this should be read as instruction-following rather than as an emergent agentic pull.

**Generation variance (`04Gf`), measured, and it changes how G2a must be read.** Every G2a number rests on one draw per cell at `temperature = 1.0`. `04Gf` re-drew 24 cells (the three low-importance features `windspeed`, `holiday`, `weekday`, plus `hr` as a ceiling control) three times each and scored every draw with both the rubric and both judges.

| Instrument | Within-cell sd | Between-modality range to resolve | Ratio |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rubric total | 0.089 | 0.064 | 1.4× |
| Judge faithfulness (Anthropic) | **0.604** | 0.333 | **1.8×** |
| Judge faithfulness (OpenAI) | 0.553 | 1.278 | 0.4× |

A single Anthropic-judge draw moves the score by nearly twice the entire modality difference. Resampling one draw per cell 5,000 times and reporting ties explicitly, **all six possible modality orderings occur**; among the 63 % of iterations with no tie between the three LLM formats, `vision` leads in 54 %, `tooluse` in 39 %, `json` in 7 %, and the modal strict ordering `vision > tooluse > json` holds in 42 % of untied iterations; the mean best-to-worst spread per draw is 0.409. A second Monte Carlo puts this on the full mean-of-18 scale: holding the ten non-redrawn cells fixed at their observed draw and resampling only the eight redrawn cells per format gives a per-format resampled-mean standard deviation of 0.08–0.10, about a quarter of the mean-of-18 modality span in the G2a table above.

Two consequences follow.
- **The null finding is strengthened on the Anthropic judge.** "No detectable modality difference" holds for a harder reason than small effects: a single draw cannot resolve which of `vision` and `tooluse` comes out on top.
- **Any claim resting on the *nominal top* of the ordering is an artefact** of the one sample drawn. Only `json` at the bottom is stable (last in 89 % of full-18 iterations).

The ceiling control behaves as it should: `hr` shows sd = 0.000 under both the rubric and the Anthropic judge, so the variance sits entirely in the near-flat stratum. One caveat on the judge side: the OpenAI judge shows sd = 0.385 even on those control cells, where the rubric and the Anthropic judge both show zero. So part of the measured spread is judge-side.

This is also the case a rubric-only study would have missed: 0.089 reads as reassuringly small, and only the judge reveals the scale.

**Judge robustness.** Both tracks are scored by two vendors under an identical rubric. Cross-vendor Krippendorff's α: per-feature Faithfulness 0.481 / Clarity 0.435 / Completeness n/a (both judges give 5 on all 72 records, the criterion is at ceiling, so α is undefined, not zero); whole-model 0.295 / 0.396 / 0.638. Reliability is **moderate at best**. OpenAI scores Faithfulness systematically stricter on the whole-model track (about 1.0 point on average, 1.17 on `vision_all`), and the two vendors order the conditions differently (the beeswarm pair flips, and `json_all` drops from second to fourth on OpenAI). Report comparisons **within one vendor**, not absolute levels.

## Local track (comparison basis): why did *this* instance get *this* prediction?

**4. Three LLM pipelines + a deterministic baseline**
All LLM pipelines use `claude-sonnet-4-6` and produce three-part explanations (`[PREDICTION]`, `[DRIVERS]`, `[RECOMMENDATION]`) for non-technical staff.

- **`04La` Template (baseline)**: a deterministic text-block generator that fills the same three-part structure from the identical SHAP/EBM JSON, with no LLM call. It answers the standard reviewer question: *what does the LLM add over a template?*
- **`04Lb` JSON → Text**: the LLM receives global importance and local SHAP/EBM contributions as structured JSON. The system prompt is cached via Anthropic prompt caching; raw values are denormalized into plain language (e.g. `temp=0.68` → `~27.9 °C`) before the call.
- **`04Lc` Vision → Text**: the LLM receives the instance's waterfall plot as a base64-encoded PNG and reads bar lengths visually (no numeric access to contribution values).
- **`04Ld` Tool-Use**: the LLM retrieves data itself through 8 defined tools (feature schema, importance, prediction, SHAP values, partial dependence, value context, similar instances, counterfactuals) in an agentic loop, averaging **6.2 tool calls** per explanation (recomputed over `results/pipeline06/`, n = 20).

**5. Evaluation** (`05_Evaluation.ipynb`, `06_Evaluation_Ichmoukhamedov.ipynb`)
Quantitative cost/latency, LLM as judge with two independent judges (Opus as the primary judge plus OpenAI gpt-4o-mini as a cross vendor robustness check, identical rubric), and formal faithfulness metrics after Ichmoukhamedov et al. (Rank / Sign / Value Agreement).

Quantitative + LLM judge (Opus) summary across 20 explanations per pipeline (2 XAI models x 10 instances):

¹ *Input tokens are the billed, non-cached count. JSON→Text caches the system prompt (cache-read tokens, billed at ~10%, are not counted here), which is why its input count is far below Vision's freshly-sent image tokens.* Values from `results/eval_summary.csv`.

Formal faithfulness after Ichmoukhamedov et al. (NB 06, n = 10 instances; precision-style metrics, see the limitation in NB 06 §4.1):

**6. Error analysis** (frozen diagnostic, kept locally, not included in the repository)
The 30 lowest faithfulness explanations were hand coded into an error taxonomy, separating genuine explanation errors (for example `yr` sign errors, near tie rank swaps) from extractor artefacts. The two dominant explanation error classes (yr sign and rank order) are fixed directly in the main generation prompts, so the main run already uses the corrected prompts. This was a **frozen diagnostic** that motivated those fixes; its learnings are now baked into the prompts (`pipeline_04/05/06`, `judge_system`) and guarded by regression tests (`tests/test_prompt_golden.py`), so the notebook itself is no longer part of the tracked pipeline.

> **Status of these findings:** descriptive/exploratory. With n = 20 explanations per pipeline, no repeated sampling and no inferential statistics, the differences below are **not** statistically confirmed (see the limitations table in `05_Evaluation.ipynb` §7). Treat them as directional. All numbers here come from the auto-generated tables above (`results/eval_summary.csv`).

1. **Judge faithfulness barely separates the pipelines.** Template, JSON→Text and Tool-Use all sit at 5.00, Vision at 4.50 (the only pipeline with non-zero variance, sd 0.69). With three pipelines pinned to the scale maximum, faithfulness is at a **ceiling** on this task and cannot rank them.
2. **Vision is the one pipeline that loses information.** Its 4.50 matches the formal Rank-Agreement (0.846 vs. 1.000 for JSON→Text and 0.988 for Tool-Use): reading bar lengths off a waterfall plot is structurally less precise than numeric access. Sign and Value Agreement are 1.000 everywhere.
3. **Clarity does not discriminate either** (4.00–4.15 across all four); the template lags only on completeness (4.80 vs. 5.00, a thinner operational recommendation).
4. **JSON→Text is the most efficient LLM pipeline** (≈ $0.009 per explanation, lowest latency 11.5 s), because system-prompt caching keeps billed input tokens low.
5. **Tool-Use produces the longest, evidence-backed explanations** (403 vs. 250 words, +61 % over JSON→Text, with partial-dependence and counterfactual support) at ~4.3× the cost and ~2.9× the latency, averaging 6.2 tool calls.
6. **Vision** costs slightly more than JSON→Text (image tokens, no caching benefit) at comparable latency, and is the weakest on faithfulness.
7. **This ceiling is why the global track exists.** A single-instance explanation is an easy task: it names three drivers, and every numeric pipeline gets them right. The differences the project is actually after only appear once the task is harder: describing a whole feature relationship, or the whole model at once. See the global track above.
8. **Judge robustness.** The judge runs on two independent models (Opus as primary, OpenAI gpt-4o-mini as a cross vendor check) under an identical rubric. Neither judge is the generation model (Sonnet), which reduces self-preference bias. It does not eliminate it, because the primary judge (Opus) comes from the same vendor. That is why the cross-vendor check exists.

Every LLM notebook is guarded by a `RUN_API` flag (default `False`): the whole non-API path (prompt assembly, payload construction, splitter, coverage, rubric) is verified against a deterministic stub that writes nothing to `results/`. Set it to `True` only for the billed run. Generation is resumable: an existing output file is never regenerated, so an interrupted run resumes where it stopped.

## LLM configuration

Generation and the primary judge use the **Anthropic Messages API**; the cross-vendor judge uses the **OpenAI API**. Run dates:
- **Local track:** API accessed **2026-06-11**.
- **Global track (final run):** **29–30 September 2026**.

Parameters are centralised in `utils/llm.py`.

| Use case | Model | `max_tokens` | `temperature` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Global per-feature generation (NB 04Gb / 04Gc / 04Gd) | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | 2048 | default (1.0) |
| Global whole-model generation (NB 04Ge) | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | **16384** | default (1.0) |
| Global judge, primary (NB 05G / 05Gb) | `claude-opus-4-8` | 900 | 0.0 |
| Global judge, cross vendor (NB 05G / 05Gb) | `gpt-4o-mini` (OpenAI) | 900 | default |
| Local explanation generation (NB 04Lb / 04Lc / 04Ld) | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | 2048 | default (1.0) |
| Local judge, primary (NB 05) | `claude-opus-4-8` | 900 | 0.0 |
| Local judge, cross vendor (NB 05) | `gpt-4o-mini` (OpenAI) | 900 | default |
| Ichmoukhamedov metrics (NB 06) | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | 700 | default (1.0) |

The whole-model ceiling is deliberately 8× the per-feature one: one answer carries nine `[FEATURE]` blocks plus a recommendation. An early run used 4096 and truncated two answers **silently**, because `stop_reason` was not persisted on the JSON/vision paths. Both fields are now written on every path, and `assert_not_truncated` gates the write.

**Reproducibility note:** Anthropic model IDs are versioned snapshots, but API behaviour (sampling, default parameters, tokenisation) can change silently between SDK releases. Results are tied to `anthropic==0.98.1` and the run dates above. Future runs against the same model ID are not guaranteed to produce identical outputs.

## Test suite

```bash
pytest tests/        # run all tests
pytest tests/test_prompt_golden.py -v   # prompt regression only
```

The suite covers sampling determinism, generation-loop persistence/resume, judge-parsing robustness, statistical functions, denormalization consistency, README consistency, and **prompt-fix regression**. For the global track it additionally covers the constructed EBM beeswarm, the global curve artefacts, ground-truth derivation, the deterministic rubric, the whole-model payloads and the forced-schema splitter, and the **output-token truncation guards** (a record that hit the ceiling must never be persisted or scored).
The prompt regression test (`test_prompt_golden.py`) freezes the SHA-256 hashes and key constraint phrases of all three pipeline prompts, including the sign- and rank-fidelity rules for `yr=0`.
It is a hard gate: a fresh generation run must not start until all tests are green.

The README consistency test is part of that gate: every numeric table in both READMEs is wrapped in `<!-- AUTO-TABLE:name -->` sentinels and regenerated from `results/` by `utils/update_readme_tables.py`. A number that drifts from its artefact fails the suite, which is what keeps two judge generations from being mixed in one document.

**If a prompt is intentionally improved:**
1. Edit the prompt file.
2. Recompute the hash: `shasum -a 256 prompts/<file>.md`
3. Update `GOLDEN_HASHES` in `tests/test_prompt_golden.py`.
4. If the constraint phrase changed, update `REQUIRED_PHRASES` in the same file.
5. Confirm `pytest tests/test_prompt_golden.py` passes.
